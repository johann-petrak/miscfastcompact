Representation:
* A node String gets converted to a node id (serial number)
* the i-th entry in the node table contains the store index of the table of adjacent node ids
  together with their relation ids or relation counts (both int)
  There are two such tables, and two stores, one for the outgoing and one for 
  the incoming edges
